EXPECTATION:
I expected the heavy weight to follow a large sin wave and the smaller weight to follow a similar wave combined with a smaller more frequent wave.

RESULT:
Both followed almost identical paths (minus the standard displacement). They obviously both act with each other and effect each other int he same way.
